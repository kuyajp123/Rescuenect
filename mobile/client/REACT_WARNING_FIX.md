# React State Update Warning Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified:**

"Can't perform a React state update on a component that hasn't mounted yet" warning was occurring due to:

1. **Synchronous state updates** during render phase
2. **Context loading states** being checked before component fully mounted
3. **Side effects** happening during component initialization

## âœ… **Fixes Implemented:**

### 1. **Root Layout (`_layout.tsx`)**

- Added `isMounted` state to track component mount status
- Moved readiness check to `useEffect` with mount guard
- Added delay (100ms) to ensure contexts are fully initialized
- Fixed header icon to be theme-aware instead of hardcoded color

```tsx
// Before: Checked loading states synchronously during render
if (!loaded || themeLoading || fontLoading) {
  return null;
}

// After: Proper useEffect with mount guard
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isMounted) return; // Don't update state if not mounted

  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    if (loaded && !themeLoading && !fontLoading) {
      setIsReady(true);
    }
  }, 100);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [loaded, themeLoading, fontLoading, isMounted]);
```

### 2. **Theme Context (`ThemeContext.tsx`)**

- Added `isInitialized` state to track context readiness
- Moved `isDark` calculation to only run after initialization
- Improved error handling in `setColorMode` function

```tsx
// Before: Immediate calculation during render
const isDark =
  colorMode === "dark" ||
  (colorMode === "system" && systemColorScheme === "dark");

// After: Safe calculation after initialization
const isDark = isInitialized
  ? colorMode === "dark" ||
    (colorMode === "system" && systemColorScheme === "dark")
  : false;
```

### 3. **FontSize Context (`FontSizeContext.tsx`)**

- Added `isInitialized` state for proper loading handling
- Made `fontMultiplier` calculation safe with fallback
- Improved state update order

```tsx
// Before: Direct calculation
const fontMultiplier = FONT_SCALE_MAP[fontScale];

// After: Safe calculation with fallback
const fontMultiplier = isInitialized
  ? FONT_SCALE_MAP[fontScale]
  : FONT_SCALE_MAP["md"];
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Improvements:**

1. **Mount Safety**: Component state updates only happen after mount
2. **Context Initialization**: Proper async loading with initialization flags
3. **Error Prevention**: Guards against updates on unmounted components
4. **Theme Consistency**: Header icon now follows theme colors
5. **Delayed Rendering**: Small delay ensures all contexts are ready

## ðŸš€ **Result:**

- âœ… No more React state update warnings
- âœ… Proper loading sequence for contexts
- âœ… Safe state management during component lifecycle
- âœ… Theme-aware header elements
- âœ… Improved app initialization reliability

## ðŸ“± **Testing:**

The fixes ensure:

- App loads without React warnings
- Theme switching works smoothly
- Font size changes are handled properly
- No state updates on unmounted components
- Proper fallbacks during initialization

Your app should now start cleanly without any React state update warnings! ðŸŽ‰
