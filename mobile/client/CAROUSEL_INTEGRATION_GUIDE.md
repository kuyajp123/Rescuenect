  subtitle: 'Stay informed with real-time alerts',
  image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  description: 'Get instant notifications about emergencies in your area.',
  action: '/notification'
}
```

## Customization Options

### 1. **Update Data**
Replace the `carouselData` array in `AdvancedCarousel.tsx` with your own data:

```typescript
const carouselData = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Your Title',
    subtitle: 'Your Subtitle',
    image: 'your-image-url',
    description: 'Your description',
    action: '/your-route'
  },
  // ... more items
];
```

### 2. **Styling Customization**

- Modify styles in the `StyleSheet` at the bottom of the component
- Adjust dimensions, spacing, colors, etc.

### 3. **Navigation Actions**
- Currently navigates to: `/notification`, `/community`, `/details`
- Modify the `action` property for each item to change navigation behavior

### 4. **Carousel Behavior**
- Loop: `loop={true}` - endless scrolling
- Auto-play: Add `autoPlay={true}` and `autoPlayInterval={3000}` props
- Pagination: Currently enabled with custom dots

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In your screen component
import { AdvancedCarousel } from '@/components/ui/carousel/AdvancedCarousel';

export default function YourScreen() {
  return (
    <View>
      <AdvancedCarousel />
    </View>
